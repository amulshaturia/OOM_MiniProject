# OOM_MiniProject

The purpose of this Java Applet is to calculate the heights of several bounces after a  ball is dropped from rest. Basically, the applet  will enable a user to visualize how various coefficients of restitution affect the motion of a  ball after impact. The user will be required to  enter a height from which the ball is to be  dropped from, as well as a value for the  coefficient of restitution by using two separate  scrollbars. The applet will then simulate the  motion of the ball. A  maximum of 10 resulting bounce height values  will be displayed at the bottom of  the applet page.
